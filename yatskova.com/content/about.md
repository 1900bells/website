I am a sound designer and musician from Washington, soon to graduate with a Bachelor of Arts in Music and Sound Design
from the DigiPen Institute of Technology in Redmond, Washington. I love video game sound design and audio recording!

Ever since I started studying professional piano performance over 14 years ago, I have been fascinated by how music and
audio impact us in our everyday lives. No matter where you go, the beauty of great sound is everywhere!

I was a huge fan of games like Animal Crossing growing up - the immersive ambient sound design and memorable, thematic
music inspired me to work on all things video game and cinematic audio. I realized from very early on that it's the
sound design in games that is one of their most nostalgic and memorable aspects!

I have experience working with music theory, composing original music, and creating sound design and audio - I
find every opportunity to use what I know to make things sound great, whether it's video games, short films,
orchestrations, or more.
