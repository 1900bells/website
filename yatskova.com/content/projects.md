# Puzzle Garden

##### Sound Designer & Composer &bull; January 2024 - April 2024)

Puzzle Garden is a short, casual puzzle game where you utilize unique land layouts and crop abilities to maximize your
profit.

I volunteered on the team that created Puzzle Garden during the second semester of my senior year. The game has a
minimalistic, cheerful soundtrack and short, punchy sound effects. I took inspiration from the soundtrack of the
original Animal Crossing for the GameCube and from the sound effects of mobile games.

# Wild Wild Wetlands

##### Sound Designer &bull; September 2023 - December 2023

Wild Wild Wetlands is 3D third-person action platformer game where a frog cowboy protects a sleepy bayou town from
bandits by gathering movement abilities to overcome their obstacles.

Wild Wild Wetlands was my first semester senior year game team project. Working on this 19-person team, I created all of
the sound effects for character feedback, such as movement and interaction. I also worked on some of the sound effect
feedback for objects and UI. For this game, I created sound effects in REAPER using self-recorded and library-sampled
sound effects and acted as a studio engineer for voice acting sessions. I was on an audio team of 2, using Wwise to
implement audio into this Unity game.

In a fantasy world, a young woman inherits her late mother’s ability to shrink down to a tiny size at will. She
discovers an entire world underneath her childhood home only accessible to the very small, and is determined to see what
she can find.

I have volunteered to create audio assets for What She Left Me, a senior year Unity engine game. Using REAPER and Wwise,
I am creating and helping implement a variety of dynamic sound effects, as well as composing an original soundtrack for
the game.

Geomancers is a 2D turn-based shooter drawing from multiple inspirations, including Worms Armageddon and Noita, as well

library sampling. I also created 8 original piano and orchestral music in REAPER and created an adaptive music system in
FMOD Studio so that the music could adjust to in-game state changes. In addition, I mixed and mastered all of the
in-game audio using REAPER and FMOD Studio.
